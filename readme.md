# V5-Sim-PROS

Welcome to the Lemlib VEX V5 Simulator! This open-source project aims to accurately simulate the full functionality of the V5 brain and PROS kernel. 

This repository includes the base device emulation layer and a modified version of PROS Kernel, and is what users of V5-Sim will build their code against.

## Features

- Full implementation of the PROS  Api; any user should be able to build programs against it with no issues whatsoever.
- (in progress) emulation of RTOS/PROS task API, resulting in good (though not identical) replication of program behavior on a V5 Brain.
- (in progress) device objects with accessible API for third party programs to use. See [v5-sim-engine](https://github.com/LemLib/v5-sim-engine) for our in progress physics engine.
- (planned) brain screen simulation, with LVGL support.

### Not Planned Currently:
- VEX IQ simulation
- VEXCode support
